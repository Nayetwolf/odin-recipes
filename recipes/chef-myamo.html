    <h3>Words of appreciation:</h3>
    <p>
      Another culinary masterpiece. Maymo's choice of ingredients never ceases
      to impress us. And the fact that he - a gorgeous lemon beagle who doesn't
      even have thumbs - can use a spatula so expertly....well, let's just say
      my canine mind was blown. Keep cooking up these feasts and wearing your
      chef's hat like the kitchen champ he is!

    <h2>ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melte</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <th><strong>Step 1</strong></th>
      <ol>
        Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes
        to "sour".
      </ol>
      <th><strong>Step 2</strong></th>
      <ol>
        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
        mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour
        mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until lumps are gone.
      </ol>
      <th><strong>Step 3</strong></th>
      <ol>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour
        1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on
        the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other
        side.
      </ol>
    </ul>
